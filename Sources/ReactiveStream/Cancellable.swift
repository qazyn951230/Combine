/// A protocol indicating that an activity or action supports cancellation.
///
/// Calling ``Cancellable/cancel()`` frees up any allocated resources. It also stops side effects such as timers, network access, or disk I/O.
public protocol Cancellable {

    /// Cancel the activity.
    ///
    /// When implementing ``Cancellable`` in support of a custom publisher, implement `cancel()` to request that your publisher stop calling its downstream subscribers. Combine doesn't require that the publisher stop immediately, but the `cancel()` call should take effect quickly. Canceling should also eliminate any strong references it currently holds.
    ///
    /// After you receive one call to `cancel()`, subsequent calls shouldn't do anything. Additionally, your implementation must be thread-safe, and it shouldn't block the caller.
    ///
    /// > Tip: Keep in mind that your `cancel()` may execute concurrently with another call to `cancel()` --- including the scenario where an ``AnyCancellable`` is deallocating --- or to ``Subscription/request(_:)``.
